![neo-processing editor in dark mode, running the Fireworks Burst example across three layers, with the Sound panel's audio level meter and output device selector open](./assets/dark-mode-sound-panel.png)

neo-processing ships as a **single self-contained executable**. It embeds a code
editor and a live preview into a native desktop window, so you can write a p5.js
sketch with the goal of real-world, full-screen deployment.

> **Status:** v0.1.1 - active development. Interfaces and features may change.

## Features

- **Native desktop app** - one executable, no browser or Node.js runtime
  required. Uses the OS webview (WebView2 on Windows, WebKitGTK on Linux).
- **Embedded editor** - syntax-highlighting code editor ([Ace](https://ace.c9.io/))
  with a resizable split between source and preview.
- **Live sketch preview** - run your sketch instantly in an isolated, sandboxed
  preview pane.
- **Record & capture** - record the composite of every visible layer to WebM
  video or capture it as a PNG frame, saved to `outputs/`.
- **Layers** - a tab strip above the editor, one independent, simultaneously-
  running sketch per tab (up to 5), each sized to its own `createCanvas()` and
  composited together in the preview pane. A Layers panel controls per-layer
  visibility (hidden layers actually stop running, not just hide), stacking
  order, opacity, and stop. See
  [docs/proposals/layer-system.md](./docs/proposals/layer-system.md) for the
  design.
- **Fullscreen preview** - present the sketch centred at its exact size on a
  white backdrop; press Esc to exit.
- **Local-first & offline** - the frontend and the bundled p5.js build are
  embedded into the binary and served from a loopback HTTP server. No internet
  access is required to run the app, **unless** you opt into an online p5.js
  build from the Libraries panel, which loads that build from a CDN.
- **Save to disk** - export the current sketch to a timestamped `.js` file under
  `outputs/`.
- **Import JS Library** - load a local `.js` file (Libraries panel) into the
  sketch iframe alongside p5.js, for libraries outside the built-in manifest.
- **Sound panel** - master on/off + a 0-1 volume slider over sketch audio
  output (muted by default), a live 0-1 level meter showing the actual
  post-gain output, and an output device selector (backed by
  `AudioContext.setSinkId()`) for pointing sketch audio at a specific
  playback device. See
  [docs/proposals/sound-section.md](./docs/proposals/sound-section.md) for the
  design (a wrapped `AudioContext.destination`, so it works with p5.sound,
  raw Web Audio, or an imported library). p5.sound itself is opt-in via the
  Libraries panel's "Include p5.sound" checkbox.
- **Light/dark theme** - toggle in the top bar; persists across restarts.

### Roadmap

- Full-screen rendering for deployed installations.
- Exporting standalone, editor-free applications per sketch.

## Architecture

neo-processing is a single C++ process:

1. A local HTTP server ([cpp-httplib](https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib))
   binds to `127.0.0.1` on an OS-assigned port.
2. The web frontend (`public/`) is **embedded into the binary at build time**
   and served from that server.
3. A native [webview](https://github.com/webview/webview) window displays the
   frontend.

User sketches run in a `sandbox="allow-scripts"` iframe (opaque origin), so
sketch code cannot reach the local HTTP API, cookies, or storage. The server
listens on loopback only and caps request sizes.

For a deeper description of the codebase, see [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md).

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

| Requirement      | Notes |
|------------------|-------|
| CMake ≥ 3.20     | Build system. |
| C++20 compiler   | Windows: Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools (MSVC). Linux: GCC or Clang. |
| Git              | Required - CMake `FetchContent` downloads dependencies from Git. |
| Internet access  | Needed on the **first** configure to download build dependencies (see below). Not needed at runtime - see "Local-first & offline" above. |

**Windows runtime:** Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime.

**Linux build/runtime libraries:** GTK 3 and WebKit2GTK development files, e.g.

```sh
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install build-essential cmake git libgtk-3-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev
```

### Build and run

```sh
# Configure (downloads dependencies on first run)
cmake -B build

# Build
cmake --build build --target neo-processing -j --config Release

# Run
#   Windows: .\build\Release\neo-processing.exe
#   Linux:   ./build/neo-processing
```

Use `--config Debug` (and the `Debug` output folder) for a debug build.

#### Helper scripts

```sh
# Windows - initialises the MSVC environment, configures, builds Debug, and runs.
.\build_and_run.bat

# Linux - configures, builds Debug, and runs.
./build_and_run.sh
```

To produce a distributable build, run `.\build_and_distribute.bat` (Windows): it
builds Release and copies the `build\Release` folder (executable, icons, and any
runtime DLLs) to `%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\neo-processing`. The Windows executable's
own file icon (as shown in Explorer, the taskbar, and Alt+Tab) is embedded at
build time from `icons/app_icon.ico` via `icons/app.rc` - no separate
post-processing step is needed.

### Releases

[`.github/workflows/build.yml`](./.github/workflows/build.yml) builds Release
distributables for Windows and Linux and publishes them to a
[GitHub Release](https://github.com/vecnode/neo-processing/releases) -
**only when a version tag (`v*.*.*`) is pushed**, or on manual trigger. It does
not run on ordinary pushes or PRs; day-to-day changes are branched, PR'd, and
merged without CI. To cut a release: bump the version in `CMakeLists.txt`
(`project(... VERSION x.y.z ...)`), tag it (`git tag vx.y.z && git push --tags`),
and the workflow builds both platforms and attaches them to the release.

## Dependencies

Downloaded automatically into the build tree (`build/_deps/`) at configure time;
not committed to the repository:

| Dependency | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| [cpp-httplib](https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib) | Local HTTP server. |
| [webview](https://github.com/webview/webview) | Native desktop window + system webview. |
| [cpp-embedlib](https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-embedlib) | Embeds `public/` into the executable. |
| Boost (`asio`, `system`) | Async infrastructure thread. |

The frontend libraries in `public/libs/` (Ace, p5.js, p5.sound) are vendored and committed.

```

## Troubleshooting

- **Windows: MinGW/MSYS2 header conflicts** (`corecrt.h` / `winnt.h` errors). MSVC
  is picking up MinGW headers. Build from a clean *Developer Command Prompt for
  VS*, or use `build_and_run.bat`, which sanitises the environment.
- **Windows: "Windows SDK version … was not found".** A stale `build/CMakeCache.txt`
  references an SDK that is no longer installed. Delete the cache and reconfigure
  (or run `build_and_run.bat`, which clears it automatically).

## Security

The app runs user-provided JavaScript inside a sandboxed WebView and a
loopback-only HTTP server. See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for the security
model and how to report a vulnerability.
